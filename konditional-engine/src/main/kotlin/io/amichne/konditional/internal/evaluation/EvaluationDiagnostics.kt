/**
 * Internal diagnostics snapshot for a single evaluation.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - Captures the outcome from exactly one deterministic evaluation
 *   against one immutable registry snapshot.
 * - Contains only trusted, fully computed data produced by core evaluation;
 *   no parsing or lazy rule inspection occurs here.
 * - `durationNanos` reflects the measured evaluation wall-clock duration
 *   for observability only and does not affect semantics.
 *
 * Boundary expectations:
 * - The snapshot is produced by Konditional internals after rule resolution
 *   and bucketing are complete.
 * - Consumers may safely read this model from internal APIs and observability
 *   integrations without additional casting of rule details beyond the
 *   [`Decision`] branch they are handling.
 *
 * Error semantics:
 * - Construction does not perform recovery or validation.
 *   Invalid intermediate state is prevented by the evaluation pipeline.
 *
 * Performance notes:
 * - This model is immutable and allocation-only.
 *   It is intended to be cheap to copy and safe to share across observers.
